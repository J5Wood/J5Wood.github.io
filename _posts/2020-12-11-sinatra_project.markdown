    I've really enjoyed building in Sinatra, and learning the basics of having real structure supporting your code. What they say is certainly true though, the more you learn the less you know. It seems every step of the way has led me down a rabbit hole of knowledge with no end in sight. It would be wonderful if time weren't an issue and you could explore every tangent to your hearts content. Unfortunately, projects have deadlines.
 
     One lesson that I learned from this project was the importance of making code that's easy to add to or change. It's tempting to build out everything you think the project will do ahead of time. However the code you think your project needs will likely not be sufficient when it comes time to implement it. Getting just the bare minimum down to point you towards your final destination is key, and may save you a lot of time. 
		 
		 In my project the things that sounded easy in my head took the longest. Halfway through I decided to change the name of an Objects attribute, and hunting down all the places I called on that attribute took some time. I can only imagine how this problem would compound in a much larger application. It was a good lesson in the value of planning and consistent design. Had I spent a little more time on the bigger picture framework before hashing out some smaller details I likely wouldv'e had less code to change.
		 
		 Something that I found to be very easy though is implementing improved methods after the main project has been built. At that point it's easy to spot repetetive or messy code, and build smarter methods to handle it. 
		 
		 At the end of the day I feel the hardest part is knowing when to stop. I feel I could spend forever adding more to the application. And that's before even getting into the styling of it. I feel I'm happy with what I've made, but not content with it. Nothing is perfect, but I'll keep trying to learn more to get closer to that unattainable goal.
