  This project was certainly daunting in the beginning. Leading up to it I was  a bit worried about my ability to code with no real prompts or code preemptively down for me to build off of. Once I started however it all seemed to naturally come together. The thing I wouldv'e done differently is the planning phase of my project. I had a decent premise to start with but I didn't put enough time into hashing out the concepts of the objects I was building. This led to not enough abstraction with my CLI flow, and I had to refactor some major parts of my object model and my CLI model after I built out the program. In the future I will attempt to visualize not just the goal of the application, but also more of the structure of the blocks that build it. Overall the project wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. I'm both anxious and excited about where this journey takes me from here.
