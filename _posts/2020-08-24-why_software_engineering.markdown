For me it's a combination of things, but mainly because my career path feels stagnant. I've been a motorcycle mechanic for almost 15 years, and I'm ready for new challenges. I've always enjoyed problem solving, and the feeling you get when something you've built or fixed works properly. Coding has interested me for some time, but I've hard a hard time figuring out what to do with it. I've really enjoyed working through multiple languages on free coding sights, but I've always been left with a "what now" feeling afterwards. I'm excited to work through the software engineering course and really build up my coding skills and see where they take me.
